* REQUIREMENTS
  
  Rudel is developed and tested only with GNU Emacs and therefore
  unlikely to run on other Emacs variants like XEmacs.

  To use Rudel, the following additional software is required:

** Collection of Emacs Development Environment Tools (CEDET)
   Cedet contains the object system Eieio, which is used in Rudel's
   object-oriented implementation. Cedet can be obtained from
   http://cedet.sourceforge.net/

** Emacs Lisp Regression Testing (ERT) (optional)
   ERT is only used for regression tests and therefore an optional
   dependency. It can be obtained here:
   http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ErtTestLibrary
   or here:
   git://github.com/ohler/ert.git

* INSTALLING

  To install Rudel, download a releases version or the current
  development version from https://sourceforge.net/projects/rudel/ and
  place the code in any directory you like.

  If your Emacs load path does not already contain the directory in
  which the code resides, add the following to your .emacs file
  (assuming the code resides in a directory called `rudel'):

  : (add-to-list 'load-path "SOMEDIR/rudel/")

  This will allow Emacs to load Rudel code, but will not actually load
  Rudel. To avoid loading all the Rudel code in every Emacs startup, I
  recommend auto loading. Auto load information is stored in a file
  called `loaddefs.el' which can be generated by executing

  : make autoloads

  in the `rudel' directory (or equivalent) mentioned above. Once the
  file has been generated, auto loading can activating by executing
  
  : (load "SOMEDIR/rudel/loaddefs.el")

  in your .emacs file.

* COMPILING

  In order to achieve better performance, Emacs can byte-compiled the
  Rudel code. This can be done by executing

  : make rudel
