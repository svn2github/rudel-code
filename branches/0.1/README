* INTRODUCTION

  Rudel is collaborative editing environment for GNU Emacs. It
  supports multiple backends to enable communication with other
  collaborative editors using different protocols.

  Since Rudel is not an application, but an extension to Emacs, it is
  not started and used like most applications (not even Emacs
  applications like Gnus). Rudel mostly works in the background to
  change the behavior of the set of Emacs buffers for which it has
  been activated.

  The user interface consists of a set of key bindings, a menu entry
  and some visual status indicators, which are added to the text and
  mode line of buffers for which Rudel has been activated.

* GETTING STARTED

  Assuming Rudel has already been installed and auto loading has been
  set up, a global Rudel mode can be enabled as follows:

  : M-x global-rudel-minor-mode

  This will enabled Rudel's key bindings and menu entry.

** JOINING A SESSION

   : M-x rudel-join-session [ C-c c j ]

   Depending on the installed Rudel backends, system environment and
   configuration, a number of questions will be asked, followed by an
   attempt to join session described by your answers.

** HOSTING A SESSION

   : M-x rudel-host-session [ C-c c h ]

   Note that the session starts out without any participating users
   (This is sometimes referred to as being a dedicated server). If you
   want to participate in the session you host, you have to join it as
   described above.
